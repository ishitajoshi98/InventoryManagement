# Inventory Management for Profit Maximization
## Overview

This project employs the Monte Carlo Simulation to optimize inventory levels for four different products. The primary objective is to determine the inventory quantity for each product that maximizes profit.

## Key Features
- Monte Carlo Simulation: Utilizes this statistical technique to forecast inventory needs and analyze profit outcomes.
- Product Range: Focuses on four distinct products, providing a comprehensive view of inventory management across different items.
- Profit Maximization Analysis: Evaluates how different inventory levels impact overall profit.
- Comparison of Review Approaches: Investigates and contrasts two main inventory review methods:
    1. Continuous Review Approach
    2. Periodic Review Approach
